                <div className='lg:mt-auto font-normal text-sm leading-relaxed opacity-80 mt-1'>The currentÂ  PPV is over priced due the monopolisation of the industry, we will charge more fair prices so that the common working man afford to see fights as we understand many people aspire to be able to watch these fights live and in person.</div>
                <div className='lg:mt-auto font-normal text-sm leading-relaxed opacity-80 mt-1'>Combat sports fighters sometimes get underpaid/taken advantage of as they are not many places that host fights etc due to monopolisation and not all fighters are prominent. Corporations receive a large amount of profits while fighters do a large amount of the work work. StageLink rewards the common people and in this scenario the fighters are comparable to common people as we aim to pay them fairly and shine light on lesser known fighters so they can improve their careers.</div>
